Hooks. People love them, people hate them. But one is for sure - hooks are there to stay and React ecosystem is going to evolve, again.

In the past it was achieved using _mixins_, which were later deprecated in favor of patterns like _render props_ and _higher order components_. But these patterns introduced additional complexity and resulted in something now called _wrapper hell_.
